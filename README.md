# HandleApiKeys
Based on the Coding Train tutorial on hiding API keys with environment variables (dotenv)

npm init ; to initialize

npm install dotenv --save ; to save the file inside package.json

node ./scriptjs ; to run

check if the .env information is in there. env file contains api key (random generated by me, doesnt do anything). Using process.env.API_KEY to access the api key. 

.gitignore file ; dont upload things which are specified here
